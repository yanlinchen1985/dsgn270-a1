# JOEY's Website Review 

**JOEY** is a premium casual restaurant which was established in Calgary in 1992. As a chain restaurant, JOEY has a general website and the own page of its 27 each branches. Mainly based on the following three aspects, I will make a review of [JOEY’s website](https://joeyrestaurants.com/).





1. ## **Visual Hierarchy**

A successful restaurant website's goal is to attract customers and promote its brand. My overall impression of JOEY’s website visuals is that it is a good website because of its concise and readable layout , photos of attractive food and dining atmosphere, a video showing the reopening plan and its short but effective text on pages. 



> *"WE FIGURE OUT WHAT EACH GUEST NEEDS AND CREATE THE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM."   JOEY*



Apart from these, the most important thing is it applies most visual hierarchy rules that I have learned in our class.

- Use different sizes and scale of texts to signify the importance of the information. Besides that, the greater words or pictures can catch viewers’ eyes easily.
- Choose the reasonable color. Although there is no very obvious color contrast, the white letters match most colors well. This makes these texts clear to read in colorful background photos.
- Alignment used in some text on its front page, especially the text written in big size, so F pattern usually can be seen. 
- Following the rule of odds is also useful to make JOEY’s website appealing. For example, viewers can follow the information clearly when they see the three cards of “menu, liquor, happy hour” in middle part of each branch’s page.
- With the very similar colors, styles and fonts, repetition make the whole website look very coordinated.

The design of the JOEY website is excellent in many aspects, but there are still somethings needed to be improved.

- Leaving more negative space could help this website more effective .

- Lots of photos used in the front page, but if considering using little bokeh effect here, it might be better.

  

2. ## **Mental models and usability**

For a commercial website, just looking good is not enough. It should not only have many useful functions but also provide a good user experience. 

Most common web design patterns can be found on JOEY's website, like *navigation tabs, cards, fat footer, calendar picker, carousel, rate content, account registration and so on*. All of these provide viewers a good experience.

- Like many restaurants, the first screen of JOEY's front page displays some food photos and obvious buttons for reserving and ordering, which is convenient for guests to place orders and make reservations. 
- In the upper left corner, there is its simple but innovative LOGO which actually is the home link.

- Autocomplete is used when viewer wants to do some search of the branch location. This is helpful for someone like me who is a newcomer here, but it will be perfect if it can show the location on the map. 


- There is an inline help box at the bottom of each page, which is convenient and necessary for customers to give suggestions and feedback. 


I nearly do not find any violations of convention. The content on its website is scannable easily by using card pattern, heading and short paragraphs. There is not any text with too low of a contrast ratio. Even though the designer would like to show minimalism somewhere, the text still is white on the dark background so that it is very readable. 



3. ## **Mobile responsiveness**

JOEY’s webpage can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. It works well in mobile browsers, but the loading speed is much slower than opening on the computer. 

Considering the mobile users very well, on its mobile website, it puts the “order now” and “reserve” button in the “thumb zone”. Even though there is not a scroll track shown on mobile devices, the top of the second photo appears in the lower part of the first screen make the user know this mobile web page is scrollable. 

On JOEY’s mobile website, viewers can find the hamburger menu in the upper right corner. After clicking it, there is a navigation drawer. Then, the menu can be found. However, the menu can’t be bookmarked for use in a QR Code. 



According to these three aspects, if there are 100 points, I will give JOEY's website 88 points. I hope this local restaurant will do better in the future.
